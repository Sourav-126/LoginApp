Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
PNPM package manager

Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

Install dependencies:
bashpnpm install

Set up your environment variables:
bashcp .env.example .env
Then edit the .env file with your database connection string and other configuration.
Run database migrations:
bashpnpm prisma migrate dev

Start the development server:
bashpnpm run start


Database Setup
This project uses Prisma ORM with your preferred database. The database connection is configured in the prisma/schema.prisma file.
Make sure to update your .env file with the correct database URL.
API Endpoints
The API provides various endpoints for user management and other features. For detailed documentation on available endpoints, refer to the API documentation.
Scripts

pnpm run start - Start the server
pnpm run dev - Start the server with hot-reload (for development)
pnpm run build - Build the TypeScript code
pnpm run lint - Run linting
pnpm run test - Run tests

Type Validation
The application uses Zod for input validation and type safety. Schemas for validation are defined within the route handlers or in separate files when appropriate.
Middleware
Express middleware functions are located in the src/middleware directory and are used for request processing, authentication, error handling, etc.
